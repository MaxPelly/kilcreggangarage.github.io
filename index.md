## Kilcreggan Garage and MOT Center

Kilcreggan Garage is approved by the Government appointed Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA). All MOT tests are completed by MOT testers approved by DVSA.

Remember, Police now have number plate recognition and can access your vehicle details instantly! If you don’t have an MOT it also invalidates your insurance.

We also offer a wide range of services, besides MOT Testing, this includes servicing, diagnostics & repairs. For more information, please feel free to visit our services page.

Don’t forget that if you book your MOT with us today we’ll give you a free pre-MOT health check. For MOT’s or any of our other services, please feel free to call us today on 01436 842898.
